I like (and I continue to learn from him) his attitude for mistakes and conflicts.\n\nI remember that when we worked together, we found a synergy between us that helped both of us to grow faster. Our communication also created a strong relationship that is still alive, and I always like to meet him over and over. If one day we are able to work together again, I will be happy!"
